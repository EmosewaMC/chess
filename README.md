Implemented FEN functionality for board positions
Implemented castling
Implemented promotion
Implemented En Passant

I realized very quickly into development, there is only 1 en passant square, so that simplified storage to being board wide
Pawm promotion is a simple texture swap
castling is a bit of hard coding, but given that the game logic is now complete, the next step for the next assignment is validity of moves (check preventing king or requiring king moves), but that is a task for next time.
